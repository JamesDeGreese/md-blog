Hello there!

This project start as experiment for create the simple website on vue.js, using only a cdn-distributable libraries, without any bundlers or compilers. This was possible with `type='module'` feature of `<sctipt>` tag. In short, this feature allows me using import and export syntax right in browser. More information you can find here.

I kept this project on the shelf, but now I found enough time to rise it up. I planing making posts about new programming languages features, that I found, tasks solutions, some of my gists, etc.
